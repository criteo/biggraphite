# Big Graphite

BigGraphite is a storage layer for timeseries data. It integrates with Graphite as a plugin.

# Backends

There is only one supported backend for now: Cassandra, whose design is [described in CASSANDRA_DESIGN.md](CASSANDRA_DESIGN.md).


# Code structure

- `biggraphite.accessor` exposes the public API to store/retrieve metrics
- `biggraphite.metadata_cache` implements a machine-local cache using [LMDB](https://lmdb.readthedocs.io) so that one does not need a round-trip for each call to `accessor`
- `biggraphite.plugins.*` implements integration with Carbon and Graphite
- `biggraphite.backends.*` implements the storage backends (eg: Cassandra-specific code)
