"""Implements the DiskCache for metrics metadata.

The DiskCache is implemented with lmdb, an on-disk file DB that can be accessed
by multiple processes. Keys are metric names, values are json-serialised metadata.
In deployment the graphite storage dir is used as a rendez-vous point where all processes
(carbon, graphite, ...) can find the metadata.

TODO(b.arnould): Currently that cache never expires, as we don't allow for deletion.
